# Cocktail Builder 🍸🍹

## Cocktail Builder is a single page web app designed to show you a list of cocktails you can build with the engredients you have on hand.

#### This web app uses the [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) API!

#### Simply put in your ingredients in the input field and the page will start showing you results. The more ingredients, the more filtered your search is. 

#### Inside the config_copy.js file, edit your API key provided after becoming a Patreon member ($2/m).
#### `const token = 'xxxxxxx';`

#### Run `npm run server` and `npm run build` in the terminal on two different processes.
